# TrinityCore-Dragonflight-Databases
Databases I collected for TrinityCore Dragonflight.

RetailCore https://discord.gg/E7hYYvyXH2 - very good project!<br />
<br>
If you want to extract the DB by yourself, there is dbextract.bat. Download the RetailCore Repack from Discord above and execute the script.
Both, script and repack, have to be in the same directory.
<br><br>
macros-cache.txt contains macros for adding shopitems, Collector's Edition items, TCG items etc.

Explanation for understanding the release filename: for example we have "RetailCoreDB_2023-07-13_tc-008c15a.7z". It's RetailCoreDB from July 13th 2023 for TrinityCore Commit 008c15a. You have to checkout and compile this commit for this DB.
